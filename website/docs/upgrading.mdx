# Upgrading to v9

DayPicker 9 includes important updates related to accessibility, styles, internationalization and performance. See the [changelog](./changelog.mdx) for the full list of changes.

V9 include some breaking changes. Follow these steps to safely upgrade DayPicker in your project.

## Checklist

1. Update the dependencies
2. Fix the CSS styles
3. Updates for ARIA labels
4. Update Formatters to return a string
5. Update translations
6. Check for deprecated props
7. Update your Custom Components
8. TypeScript: deprecated types

### 1. Update the dependencies

Update `react-day-picker` via npm. Remove `date-fns` from the dependencies if you are not using it directly in your app.

```bash npm2yarn
npm install react-day-picker@next
npm uninstall date-fns # optional
```

### 2. Fix the CSS styles

Make sure you import `react-day-picker/style.css` in your project:

```diff
- import 'react-day-picker/dist/style.css';
+ import 'react-day-picker/style.css';
```



### 3. Updates for ARIA labels

The following ARIA labels have been updated:

| Label                                                   | Old label              | New label                  |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- | -------------------------- |
| [`labelPrevious`](./api/functions/labelPrevious)        | `Go to previous month` | `Go to the Previous Month` |
| [`labelNext`](./api/functions/labelNext)                | `Go to next month`     | `Go to the Next Month`     |
| [`labelWeekNumber`](./api/functions/labelWeekNumber.md) | `Week nr. #`           | `Week ##`                  |

You may need to update your test selectors â€” for example:

```diff title="./test.js"
- screen.getByRole('button', 'Go to previous month');
+ screen.getByRole('button', 'Previous Month');
```

### 4. Update Formatters to return a string

If you are using [custom formatters](./docs/localization.mdx#formatters), the `formatters` functions now return a `string` instead of a `ReactNode`.
Use [custom components](./guides/custom-components.mdx) to further customize the rendering of the caption, weekdays, and days.

```diff
- const MyComponent = () => <DayPicker formatters={{ caption: () => <strong>My caption</strong> }} />;
+ const MyComponent = () => <DayPicker formatters={{ caption: () => 'My caption' }} />;
```

### 5. Update translations

If you are offering DayPicker in multiple languages, you may need to update the translations. See the updated [translation guide](https://daypicker.dev/next/docs/translation).

### 6. Check for deprecated props

The following props have been deprecated, and will be removed in the next major version.

| Deprecated prop | Notes                                                           |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ~`fromMonth`~   | Renamed to `startMonth`.                                        |
| ~`toMonth`~     | Renamed to `endMonth`.                                          |
| ~`fromYear`~    | Use `startMonth` instead: e.g. `startMonth = new Date(2024,0)`. |
| ~`toYear`~      | Use `endMonth` instead: e.g. `endMonth = new Date(2024,11)`.    |
| ~`fromDate`~    | Use `startMonth` with the `hidden` prop.                        |
| ~`toDate`~      | Use `startMonth` with the `hidden` prop.                        |

#### About removing `fromDate` and `toDate`

When using `startMonth` and `endMonth`, set the `hidden` prop to hide the unwantend days.

```diff
- <DayPicker fromDate={new Date(2010, 11, 03)} toDate={new Date(2012, 10, 01)} />
+ <DayPicker startMonth={new Date(2010,11)} startMonth={new Date(2012,10)}  hidden={[{ before: new Date(2010, 11, 03)}, { after: new Date(2012, 10, 01) }]} />
```

### 7. Update your Custom Components

In case you are using DayPicker hooks in your custom components, you need to update your code:

| Hook              | Upgrade Note                                                                                                   |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ~`useNavigation`~ | Included into [`useDayPicker`](./api/functions/useDayPicker.md).                                               |
| ~`useDayRender`~  | Removed in favor of the `Day` custom component. See [custom components guide](./guides/custom-components.mdx). |

### 8. TypeScript: deprecated types

Many typings have been deprecated in favor of clarity and shorter names. If you were using the typings, you may need to update your code or it will break in the next major version.

```diff
- import type { DayPickerDefaultProps } from 'react-day-picker';
+ import type { PropsBase } from 'react-day-picker';
```
